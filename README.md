Augmented Reality Based On Ontology

Augmented Reality based on Ontology (ARBOO) is a project built on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA),
along with the use of several components such as: (Text Processing, Stemming, Data-Mining, Ontologies and Image Retrieval).


The system receives a lesson-script by scanning tags/glyphs, analyses that script by extracting and matching keywords with ontology and then retrieves an image for the main object of the lesson and projects it onto the screen.
