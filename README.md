Augmented Reality Based On Ontology (ARBOO)
=====

ARBOO is a project built on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA),
along with the use of several components such as: (Text Processing, Stemming, Data-Mining, Ontology and Image Retrieval).


What it does
=====

The system receives a lesson-script by scanning tags/glyphs, analyses that script by using data-mining algorithms, extracts and matching keywords with ontology and then retrieves the most accurate images for the main object of the lesson-script and projects it onto the screen.


Uses
=====
- Can be used if you need to search for something that you do not know but are able to describe it.

  Example: You forgot the name of a shape, but you are able to describe it as "It's a shape that has 12 ribs, has 24       angles and has a soft texture". 


  RESULT: Cube.
  
- Provides an automated, unique and exciting technology that improves teaching children with intellectual disabilities, children that have difficulties memorizing or even suffer from having a short attention span by combining Augmented Reality with Ontology.
